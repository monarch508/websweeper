## Uncommitted Work in Progress

Watch mode is implemented but **not yet committed** and **not yet tested against a live site**. Working tree as of 2026-05-14:

- New: `src/websweeper/watcher.py` (persistent-browser polling loop with keepalive)
- New: `CLAUDE.md` (this fleshed-out version, replacing the external scaffold)
- Modified: `src/websweeper/runner.py` (extracted `run_extraction()` for reuse by the watcher)
- Modified: `src/websweeper/config.py` (`keepalive_url` field on `SessionConfig`)
- Modified: `src/websweeper/cli.py` (`watch` command + `_parse_duration` helper)
- Modified: `extensions/finance/actions.py` (`watch-bofa` action)
- Modified: `extensions/finance/configs/bofa_checking.yaml` (`keepalive_url` set)

83 tests still pass with these changes. Next step is a live watch-mode run against BofA.

## What's Built (Phase 1 — Complete)

Phase 1 delivered the full base framework through 8 iterative MVPs:

| MVP | Capability | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Playwright proof of life (google.com screenshot in WSL2) | Done |
| 1 | Step executor (fill, click, select, wait + 5 target types) | Done |
| 2 | YAML config loading with Pydantic validation | Done |
| 3 | Credential resolution from env vars + auth flow | Done |
| 4 | Diagnostic capture on failure (screenshot, a11y tree, error log) | Done |
| 5 | Table extraction + data transforms + CSV output | Done |
| 6 | Session persistence (storageState, TTL, chmod 600) | Done |
| 7 | Click CLI + finance extension registration via entry points | Done |

### Test Suite

**83 tests, all passing** (as of 2026-03-17)

```
tests/test_config.py          — 19 tests (config loading, Pydantic validation)
tests/test_credentials.py     — 6 tests (env var resolution, error cases)
tests/test_executor.py         — 18 tests (target resolution, step execution, mocks)
tests/test_session.py          — 6 tests (TTL, file management)
tests/test_transforms.py      — 17 tests (parse_date, parse_currency)
tests/test_output.py           — 5 tests (CSV writing, static fields, column ordering)
tests/test_diagnostics.py     — 1 test (full diagnostic package capture)
tests/test_integration.py     — 5 tests (end-to-end login → extract → CSV)
```

Integration tests run against `tests/fixtures/test_page.html` — a local HTML page with a login form and transactions table containing 4 known rows.

## Phase 2 Progress: BofA Checking (In Progress)

### Completed
- [x] BofA checking config with real selectors (`extensions/finance/configs/bofa_checking.yaml`)
- [x] Login flow: User ID (`#oid`), Password (`#pass`), Log in button (`#secure-signin-submit`)
- [x] SMS MFA flow: click Next (`#ah-authcode-select-continue-btn`) → enter code (`#ahAuthcodeValidateOTP`) → remember device (`#rememberDevice`) → submit (`#ah-authcode-validate-continue-btn`)
- [x] Interactive MFA: code entered via stdin (terminal) or browser window (headed mode)
- [x] Session reuse verified — subsequent headless runs skip login/MFA entirely
- [x] `getbofastatements` action wired to real config + `run_site()`
- [x] Transaction extraction working: 50 rows extracted from `#txn-activity-table` with `tbody tr.activity-row` rows
- [x] CSV output with date, description, type, amount, account, source columns
- [x] `goto` action added to executor for direct URL navigation
- [x] Diagnostic repair workflow validated (broken selector → screenshot + a11y tree + error log captured)
- [x] Auto re-auth — detects stale server-side sessions, clears cookies, re-authenticates
- [x] PDF statement download — JS event dispatch triggers BofA's Vue framework, Playwright captures download
- [x] `getbofastatementpdfs` action — downloads statement PDFs (eStmt_2026-03-09.pdf, 281KB, 14 pages)
- [x] `pdf_download` extraction mode added to base framework with `PdfDownloadConfig`
- [x] Watch mode — persistent browser with keepalive polling (`watcher.py`, `watch`/`watch-bofa` commands). **Uncommitted, untested live.** Shelved as a feature per D20; see "Auth strategy" below.

### Auth strategy (D20, 2026-05-14)

Plaid and other financial aggregators are explicitly off the table. Pursue DIY techniques in order:

1. **Verify device-trust cookie + session reuse gives MFA-free fresh logins.** Highest priority next step. Inspect `sessions/bofa_checking_state.json`, identify the device-trust cookie and its expiry, then let the session cookies go stale and run `getbofastatements` to observe whether MFA is prompted.
2. **Check BofA TOTP support.** Config schema already supports `mfa.type: totp`. If BofA offers authenticator-app MFA, adopt it for fully unattended fresh logins.
3. **Email-code retrieval via Gmail MCP** as a fallback if 1 and 2 do not suffice.

### Remaining
- [ ] Verify device-trust cookie behavior (auth-strategy step 1 above)
- [ ] Inspect BofA security settings for TOTP support (auth-strategy step 2)
- [ ] Commit pending watch-mode work as shelved-but-preserved, with D20 referenced in the commit message
- [ ] Transaction deduplication for any polling (relevant only if watch mode is revived)
- [ ] Date parsing for "Processing" entries (currently passed through as-is, not transformed)

### Key Findings
- **BofA MFA is SMS-based**, not push. The flow is: login → "Get authorization code" page → click Next → enter code → remember device → submit
- **"Remember this device"** reduces MFA frequency but doesn't eliminate it
- **Session TTL is shorter than expected** — BofA sessions expire in practice well before the configured 12h. The `storageState` cookies become invalid, and the site redirects to the public homepage with `SMAUTHReason=0`
- **Transaction table** is `#txn-activity-table` with class `activity-row` for data rows. Columns: date-cell, desc-cell (.desc-text for clean text), type-cell, amount-cell, avail-balance-cell
- **Pending transactions** show "Processing" instead of a date
- **Navigation requires `goto` action** — with session reuse, the login_url loads the public homepage, not the accounts page. Must navigate to `secure.bankofamerica.com/myaccounts/brain/redirect.go?source=overview` explicitly
- **Account link selector**: `a[name='DDA_details']` for checking account on the overview page

## What's Not Built Yet

### Phase 2 Remaining: Hardening
- [ ] Statement download by date range (year dropdown + expandable categories on Statements page)
- [ ] Live verification of watch mode's auto re-auth path (the code path exists in `watcher._ensure_authenticated`; not yet exercised against a real expired session)

### Phase 3: Financial Extension — Classification
- [ ] Vendor-to-category mapping engine
- [ ] Category schema (Major:Minor taxonomy, 19 groups, 56 subcategories)
- [ ] Label schema (activity, trigger, necessity, who)
- [ ] Classification rules engine (amount thresholds, conditional logic)
- [ ] Finance-specific CSV output with classification + labels columns
- [ ] Import seed data from 2024 BofA characterization (~712 vendors)

### Phase 4: Multi-Site Expansion
- [ ] Chase, Citi (421, 431), Target RedCard, Best Buy/Citi, BofA Savings configs
- [ ] Generalize table extraction across different bank DOM structures
- [ ] `run-all` command
- [ ] `status` command (run history tracking)

### Phase 5: Scheduling and Polling
- [ ] Cron/systemd timer integration
- [ ] Transaction deduplication
- [ ] Incremental extraction (only new since last pull)
- [ ] Rate limiting and backoff
- [ ] On-call activation mode

### Phase 6: Hardening
- [ ] 1Password CLI credential provider
- [ ] PII sanitization in diagnostic captures
- [ ] Session file encryption at rest
- [ ] Failure alerting (email, ntfy)
- [ ] VPS deployment playbook

### Open Questions
- [ ] `page_scrape` extraction mode — what is the use case? Flagged for clarification.
